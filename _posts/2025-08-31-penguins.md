New introduction to penguines.
Did you know that penguins have a secret society? Every year, on the last day of August, penguins from all over the world gather for the Great Penguin Parade. They waddle in perfect formation, wearing tiny bow ties and sunglasses, showing off their best dance moves.
Legend says the parade began with Sir Flippersworthâ€™s legendary moonwalk challenge. Today, penguins worldwide join in, tossing fish-shaped confetti and squawking in perfect harmony.

So next time you see a penguin, ask them about the parade. If they wink, you know you're in on the secret!
